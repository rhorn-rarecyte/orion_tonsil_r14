  Header: This is a 20-marker whole-slide scan of a single tonsil section stained
    with TissuePlexTM Reagents and imaged using the Orion Instrument. All markers
    were stained in a single staining procedure and imaged in a single scan. Use the
    arrow keys above for a tour of this tonsil section.

      Description: 'Cancer tissue micro-environments contain numerous cell types,
        including epithelial, immune, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells
        in a spatial context for immune response. In tonsil, B cell follicles with
        germinal centers and T cell interfollicular zones define the lymphoid compartments.
        Blood vessels are revealed by CD31 and smooth muscle actin (SMA). Note that
        venules are SMA negative. Cytokeratin and E-cadherin co-stain mucosal and
        crypt lining.


        Displayed markers: CD20 (B cells, gray); CD31 (vascular endothelium and crypt
        sub-mucosa, green); SMA (arterioles, red); E-cadherin (mucosal and crypt epithelium,
        magenta); and pan-cytokeratin (mucosal and crypt epithelium, cyan).'

      Description: 'PD-L1 and PD-1 are immune checkpoint markers involved in tumor
        evasion of the immune system, and their expression on tumor cells and within
        the tumor microenvironment impacts response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
        In tonsil, PD-L1 is expressed by crypt-lining cells, and PD-1 is found scattered
        in the follicles. CD68 positive macrophages are present adjacent to the crypt
        lining.


        Displayed markers: SYTOX blue (nucleus, gray); PD-1 (germinal centers, yellow);
        PD-L1 (crypt sub-mucosa, green); CD20 (B cells, blue); CD3e (T cells, magenta),
